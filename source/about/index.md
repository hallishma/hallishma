>We are not now that strength which in old days
>Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are;
>One equal temper of heroic hearts,
>Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
>To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. 
>—from the poem ‘Ulysses’ by Alfred Lord Tennyson.
<p>I am twenty-one years old.</p>
<p>I laugh with abandon. I have wild ambition. I have passion that often treads the fine line between impracticality and fervour. I read an awful lot. I was named after a comet that was the first to be imaged by an interplanetary spacecraft but is extremely shy and only shows itself to us once in seventy-six years. I am not succinct and that can get annoying at times.</p>
<p>I love deeply.</p>
<p>Above all, I ceaselessly pray and hope.</p>
<p>I have much to do here.</p>
<p>Writing is my confidant, a proper companion to have in endeavours such as this. You will find some of my thoughts here as I journey through life. They will be edited but honest. You will also find me battling—and winning against my chronic perfectionism to write the most perfect Kafkaesque sentences ever before I hit ‘post’.</p>
<p>I am thrilled that you are here.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br>
Hallishma.
